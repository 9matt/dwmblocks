# dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm. The default location of scripts is in /opt/dwmblocks/scripts (unless changed in blocks.h). Some scripts do not update regularly, but only change when they receive a signal. Refer to [Luke Smith's dwmblocks repo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks) for advice on how to set this up. 
Thanks to [dwt1](https://gitlab.com/dwt1) for some of the scripts.
