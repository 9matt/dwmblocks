Modular status bar for dwm.

# Scripts 
The scripts should be located in ~/local/bin/sb-scripts. You can find them in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/9matt/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/.local/bin/scripts) repo. 
Some scripts do not update regularly, but only change when they receive a signal. Refer to [Luke Smith's dwmblocks repo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks) for advice on how to set this up. 
Some of the scripts are stolen from [dwt1](https://gitlab.com/dwt1), thank you!
